Introduction

Description

	The game consists of a plane surrounded by four walls. Different coloured circles are generated from the centre of the screen at regular intervals and start moving towards the walls. When a wall is struck it is reflected by obeying the laws of reflection. There is a state coloured circle changing it’s cooler at the top right. You need to tap a circle of that same colour to score points. If you hit the wrong one, then it is game over.
